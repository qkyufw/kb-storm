# Keyboard Storm: Streamline Your Thinking with a Keyboard-Driven Experience

[ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆæœ¬](./introduction.md) | **English Version**

Compared to pen and paper, does creating mind maps on a computer feel clunky and frustrating? I recently used AI to build a **keyboard-driven** whiteboard toolâ€”**[Keyboard Storm (kb-storm)](https://github.com/qkyufw/kb-storm)**.

This isnâ€™t a feature-packed giant but a focused solution to one core problem: **ensuring your thought process flows without operational interruptions.**

## The Pain Point: Why Traditional Tools Frustrate Your Workflow?

Think about the whiteboard tools you commonly use:

1. Inspiration strikes -> Grab the mouse, drag or click to create a card -> Double-click to position the cursor -> Switch to the keyboard to type.
2. Next idea -> Repeat the process...

This cycle forces you to switch between mouse and keyboard, disrupting your flow of ideas. Precious attention gets lost on operations instead of thinking. **Keyboard Storm eliminates this friction.**

## The Solution: Keyboard-Driven, Flow State First

Keyboard Stormâ€™s core design is simple:

1. **Instant Creation: Start Typing with `Alt+Enter`:**

    - Press `Alt+Enter`, and a **styled card** appears instantly in the visible screen area (randomly placed).

    - The **cursor auto-focuses** inside the card, letting you type immediately.

    - Done with one idea? Hit `Alt+Enter` again, and the next card is ready. **Seamless actions keep your ideas flowing.**

2. **Keyboard Controls Everything:**
    - Beyond creating and typing, you can select cards (`1` + arrow keys), move cards (`2` + arrow keys), connect cards (`I` + arrow keys + `Enter`), and switch colors or arrows (`Tab`)â€”**all core actions are keyboard-driven**. Keep your hands on the keyboard and your eyes on your ideas, **reducing cognitive load.**

3. **Record First, Organize Later:**

    - During a burst of inspiration, use `Alt+Enter` to quickly capture ideas as they come.

    - Once your cards are created, take your time to drag positions, connect ideas, or adjust styles using the keyboard or mouse. **Separating idea capture from organization** boosts efficiency.

## Why This Design Works?

- **Lower Cognitive Load:** Fewer switches between keyboard and mouse mean your mind stays focused on thinking.

- **Promote Flow State:** Smooth, uninterrupted actions help you dive into deep, focused thinking.

- **Free Your Memory:** Ideas instantly become cards on the screen, reducing the need to hold them in your mind.

- **Spark Unexpected Connections:** Random card placement and reorganization can bring unrelated ideas closer, fostering new insights.

- **Leverage Spatial Memory:** Card positions serve as visual cues, helping you recall and organize information.

## Want to Try?

1. **Open Online Version:** https://qkyufw.github.io/kb-storm/

2. **Core Actions:** Press `Alt+Enter` to create a card and start typing. Finish, then press `Alt+Enter` for the next idea.

3. **Keyboard Organization:**

    - `1` + arrow keys: Select a card.

    - `2` + arrow keys: Move selected card (`Shift` to move faster).

    - `I` + arrow keys + `Enter`: Connect cards.

    - `Tab`: Change card or line style.

4. **Export Results:** Save as images, Mermaid code (for creating diagrams), or Markdown with position data.

## Use Cases

- **Quick Brainstorming:** Capture fleeting ideas as fast as you can type.

- **Knowledge/Note Organization:** Jot down key points first, then map out connections to visualize your knowledge.

- **Free Writing/Journaling/Reflection:** Write thoughts freely, then organize them later.

- **Markdown Import:** Use `---` to separate ideas in any editor, then import them as a card array.

## What's More

To be honest, Iâ€™m a React beginner, so this project may have its rough edges. Keyboard Storm came to life thanks to **AI toolchains** (Cursor, Copilot, Claude, GPT-4o, DeepSeek, Gemini, etc.).

Love for you to help improve this project or give it a star!
